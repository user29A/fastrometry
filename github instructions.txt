To develop fastrometry:

Prequisites:
- C compiler (for Windows, you may need to install one and add it to your PATH environment variable)
- Cython 0.29.30. Use pip to install it: "pip install cython=0.29.30"

1. On Github, fork the fastrometry repository, and then clone your project onto your computer.
2. Navigate to the fastrometry folder
3. Do your development work
4. When you want to test your work, type: "python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel". This will produce a wheel file in the dist/ subfolder.
5. Navigate to the dist folder and uninstall fastrometry: "pip uninstall fastrometry"
6. Reinstall fastrometry using the newly-generated wheel file: "pip install fastrometry-1.0.5-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl" (as an example of a wheel file name)
7. Navigate back up one folder ("cd .."). You can now run your edited version of fastrometry. Repeat steps 3-7 if necessary.
8. When satisfied, upload the code to your Github repository.
9. Open a pull request using the "Contribute" dropdown button. We will review your pull request.
10. Thank you for contributing to fastrometry.
